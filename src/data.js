    q: 'Does a stretch ceiling look like plastic?',

  // },
  {
    q: 'Is the material easy to tear?',
    a: 'In everyday use, no. The film is tough and holds its tension; only a deliberate cut from a sharp object will damage it, and a single panel can usually be repaired or replaced without dismantling the whole ceiling.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is it safe around lighting and heat?',
    a: 'Yes, when the system is installed correctly. Fixtures and other equipment are mounted to the original structure above the membrane, with reinforced openings where required. Fire ratings vary by membrane system and material.',

  {
    q: 'How much room height do I lose?',
    a: 'Usually 1 to 2 inches — just enough to clear the hidden perimeter track. A backlit translucent ceiling is the exception, since it needs more depth between the LED and the membrane so the light spreads evenly.',
